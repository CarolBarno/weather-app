Do: - git clone 'link to the repo' 
    - git checkout dev (we have 2 main branches: dev is what we will use for development)
    - git checkout -b feat/{name} (name of the branch where you will be making your changes, then push to the repo)
    - then we'll make a pr request from github to dev as destination branch
